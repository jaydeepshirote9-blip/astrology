### How My Journey into Self-Awareness Began

Working in the field of employability for the past decade, I regularly used tools like SWOT analysis and the Johari Window to help individuals understand their strengths, areas for improvement, and interpersonal dynamics. While these tools provided valuable insights, I felt that something deeper was missing—something that could offer a more personal and intuitive understanding of oneself.

That curiosity led me to explore numerology and astrology, initially out of personal interest. Over time, I realized that these ancient sciences could significantly enhance traditional self-assessment tools by offering a holistic and insightful perspective on personality, purpose, and potential.

With this vision in mind, I developed a new concept: a structured, three-page Self-Awareness Report that merges numerology, astrology, and psychological tools to empower individuals with clarity, direction, and confidence in their personal and professional lives.

### About Me

Hello, I'm **Jaydeep Sirote**.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Walchand Institute of Technology, completed in 2012. Over the past decade, I've dedicated my career to teaching and training, with a mission to help individuals unlock their potential and achieve meaningful goals.

I've had the privilege of teaching more than **10,000 students** and directly impacting over **5,000 students** through employability training and personal growth programs. My work has focused on building strong foundations in aptitude, communication, and mindset—essentials for both career success and life satisfaction.

In the last five years, I've also developed a deep connection with numerology and spirituality, which have added new dimensions to my understanding of personal development and self-awareness.

Through this platform, I aim to blend my engineering and teaching experience with my passion for numerology and spiritual growth—offering practical insights and tools to support you on your journey to a balanced, fulfilling life.
