# Gmail App Password Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup for Gmail Email Service

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com)
2. Click on **Security** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click **2-Step Verification**
4. Follow the steps to enable it (if not already enabled)

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Still in **Security** settings
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **App passwords**
3. You might need to sign in again
4. Select **Mail** as the app
5. Select **Other (Custom name)** as the device
6. Enter "Astrology Backend" as the custom name
7. Click **Generate**

### Step 3: Copy the App Password
- Google will show you a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
- **Copy this password** (you won't see it again)

### Step 4: Update Your .env File
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the backend folder
2. Update these lines:
```bash
EMAIL_USER=jaydeep.shirote@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

**Important Notes:**
- âœ… Use the 16-character App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password
- âœ… Keep the spaces in the password or remove them (both work)
- âœ… Never share this password publicly
- âœ… You can revoke this password anytime from Google Account settings

### Step 5: Test the Configuration
Run the backend server and check the console for:
```
âœ… Email service is ready
```

If you see an error, double-check:
- 2-Step Verification is enabled
- App Password is correct
- Email address is correct
