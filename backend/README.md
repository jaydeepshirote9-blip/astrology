- **Webhook Signature Verification**: Ensures webhook authenticity

## Error Handling

The API returns standardized error responses:

  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request (validation errors)
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Payment Flow

1. Frontend calls `/api/payment/create-order`
2. Backend creates order with Cashfree
3. Frontend receives payment session ID
4. Customer completes payment on Cashfree
5. Cashfree sends webhook to `/api/payment/webhook`
6. Backend processes webhook and updates status
7. Customer is redirected to success page

## Webhook Security

Webhooks are verified using HMAC SHA256 signature to ensure they come from Cashfree.

## Testing

Use the health check endpoint to verify the server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Check payment service health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payment/health
```
